# Branding Guidelines

The following section will describe the guidelines we ask to be enforced when designing media for or about BismuthMC. You are under no legal obligation to follow these rules, but following them will result in a cleaner, more consistent look, in line with what we are making for official media.

## Logos, icons, backgrouds...

All of our branding resources (and their project files) are provided in their respective directories inside this repo. 

You can get them by downloading the repo as .zip or executing `git clone https://github.com/bismuthmc/bismuthmc.github.io.git` in your terminal/command line. (https://git-scm.com/)

## Colours

We ask for the following colours to be used for any media on/about Crystal or in relation to it: 
 
###### Background: 

- ![#2B2B2B](https://via.placeholder.com/15/2B2B2B/000000?text=+) `#2B2B2B`

###### General Colour Scheme:

- ![#000000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/000000/000000?text=+) `#000000`


## Fonts

Typically, for official graphics we prefer to use [Open Sans](https://github.com/googlefonts/opensans)
